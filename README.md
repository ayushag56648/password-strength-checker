# 🔒 Password Strength Checker (Python)

A simple Python program that checks the strength of a password based on common security rules such as length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

##  Features

 Checks if the password:
- Has **at least 8 characters**
- Contains **uppercase letters (A–Z)**
- Contains **lowercase letters (a–z)**
- Includes **at least one number (0–9)**
- Includes **at least one special character** (`@ $ ! % * ? &`)

* Gives clear feedback on what’s missing  
* Easy to run — no external libraries required

##  How It Works

The program uses **regular expressions (regex)** to test your password for each rule.  
If any condition fails, it immediately tells you what’s missing.  
Otherwise, it returns:  
> **Strong Password ✅**
